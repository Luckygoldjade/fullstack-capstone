# Capstone Project: Job Tracker App called Jobscript

Jobscript is a web-based application designed to streamline job hunting by helping users organize and manage their career pursuits in one centralized platform. Jobscript provides tools to track applications, maintain networking contacts, and monitor growth in key technical skills. Its intuitive layout and targeted features make it ideal for job seekers who want a clearer view of their progress and greater control over their career planning.

This repository contains my independent copy of a collaborative capstone project completed as part of the Computer Science program at Oregon State University.
